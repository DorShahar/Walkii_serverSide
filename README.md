# Walkii_serverSide
The server side of walkii project - IDC Herzliya mLab (media lab).

This is the first server that I (Dor Shahar) created.
The function here are as the mLab menter requested during the prohect year. With that beenig said, most of the functions did not used at Walkii MVP app. However - they do work and tested with Postman.

Server was written with Node.js , and deployed with Heroku.
